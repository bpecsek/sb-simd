#+TITLE: sb-simd

This library provides a convenient SIMD interface for SBCL.  See the
examples.

Please, do not (yet) rely on this library.  A lot of it is work in
progress.  Once everything has matured, we intend to make this code an SBCL
contrib.

Thanks everyone at #sbcl20 for helping me figure out SBCL's internals.
